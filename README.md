# NYC-School-Survey-project

An ongoing RStudio (v1.2.1335) examining the relationships between NYC demographic and 2011 survey data.

Files:

1. NYC-School-Perceptions.docx: RStudio Markdown doc with code, notes, and plots.
2. NYC Schools box plot-question.pdf: A plot of the survey questions by respondent (teacher, parent, student), created in RStudio using ggplot. See docx file for more info.
3. NYC Schools box plot-response_type: A plot that breaks down each question category by respondent, created in RStudio using ggplot. See docx file for more info. 

Initial conclusions: Of the three respondents, the teachers had both a wider range of scores as well as higher scores in general than either parents or students. The parents and students scored safety and respect higher than other question groups. Students had the lowest overall scores of the groups, indicating an area of improvement for the New York City school system.
